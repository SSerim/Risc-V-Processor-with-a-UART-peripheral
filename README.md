# Risc-V-Processor-with-a-UART-peripheral
This project presents the implementation of a RISC-V processor capable of executing a subset
of instructions, enabling it to perform data processing, memory operations, branching, and
jumping tasks. In addition to core instruction execution, the processor also includes a UART
(Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) peripheral, which allows communication
with external devicesâ€”enabling interaction with the outside world.
